TimeSummary
===========
This is a little time tracking application I use to help me with my time sheets. It's also what I use to keep my coding skills from completely dying.

I track my time in Evernote so that I can update it anywhere. I then cut and paste the tracking details into this application for a quick summary so I don't have manually calculate it.

Format:  StartTime - EndTime Project [Comment]
